LinkedIn Profile Evaluator

Problem Statement

Recruiters and hiring managers often struggle to quickly assess the quality of a candidate's LinkedIn profile. Many profiles lack completeness, impactful content, or engagement, making it difficult to gauge a candidate’s suitability for a job.

This script evaluates LinkedIn profiles based on completeness, quality, engagement, and first impression to help job seekers improve their profiles and increase their chances of getting hired.

Solution

This Python script takes a LinkedIn profile URL as input, simulates profile data extraction (since LinkedIn scraping requires authentication), and evaluates the profile based on four key criteria:

Completeness (40%) – Checks for headline, summary, experience, education, skills, photo, and contact details.

Quality of Content (30%) – Assesses job descriptions, skill endorsements, recommendations, and language use.

Engagement and Appeal (20%) – Analyzes profile activity, certifications, and use of relevant keywords.

First Impression (10%) – Evaluates the effectiveness of the headline and overall visual appeal.

The script then calculates a total score and estimates the likelihood of getting an interview based on profile strength.

How to Use:-

Install Required Libraries:

!pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Run the Script:-

python linkedin_profile_evaluator.py

Enter the LinkedIn Profile URL:-
When prompted, input the LinkedIn profile URL you want to evaluate.

View Results:
The script will display a breakdown of scores for each category, the total score, and an estimated interview likelihood.

Example Output-

Enter LinkedIn profile URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sampleprofile/
{
    'profile_url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/sampleprofile/',
    'breakdown': {
        'completeness': 32.0,
        'quality': 22.5,
        'engagement': 15.0,
        'first_impression': 10.0
    },
    'total_score': 79.5,
    'likelihood_of_interview': 'high'
}

Notes-

This script simulates LinkedIn profile data extraction. Real scraping requires authentication and compliance with LinkedIn’s terms of service.

It can be extended to integrate with LinkedIn’s API (if access is granted) for real-time profile analysis.

Future Enhancements-

Implementing OAuth authentication for real LinkedIn data retrieval.

Adding a web-based interface for easy use.

Enhancing AI-based scoring with natural language processing (NLP) to assess profile descriptions more effectively.
